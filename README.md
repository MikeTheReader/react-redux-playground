# React-Redux Playground

This is a React/Redux playground environment that I'm using to experiment with all things React/Redux.

Currently, I'm experimenting with the best way to handle REST connections, so I'm using the fantastic https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
set of sample JSON APIs to play around with things. Currently, it uses redux-thunk to handle the asynchronous requests.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
